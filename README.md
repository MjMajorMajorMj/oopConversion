### OOP challenge

##### non OOP (procedural)
- in procedural.html
	- using standard js/jquery, add the functionality listed in the comments
- in proceduralMulti.html
	- adapt your JS from procedural.html to work with all 3 inputs

##### OOP
- in oopBasic.html
	- use the AdjustableInput constructor to create 3 instances of the AdjustableInput object.
		- AdjustableInput parameters: 
		- parentContainer - a dom reference to the element that is the parent for an input group.  For example an ID string such as "#someElement"
		- initialValue - a number to start the counter at
- in oopAdvanced.html
	- this is just a more sophisticated version oh oopBasic.
